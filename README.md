DICOM 3D Medical Image Modeling (DMIM)

Nowadays, patients are sent to MRI, PET, and CT scans more than before. Each scan produces a large amount of information of a patient, normally as a set of 2D slices, that will be inspected by a doctor or a technician. The project aims to visualize any DICOM images by creating a 3D model in addition to the classic slice-by-slice inspection.

## Medical Imaging Server for DICOM \*

The Medical Imaging Server for DICOM is an open source DICOM server that is easily deployed on Azure. It allows standards-based communication with any DICOMweb™ enabled systems, and injects DICOM metadata into a FHIR server to create a holistic view of patient data. The Medical Imaging Server for DICOM integrates tightly with the [FHIR Server for Azure](https://github.com/microsoft/fhir-server) enabling healthcare professionals, ISVs, and medical device vendors to create new and innovative solutions. FHIR is becoming an important standard for clinical data and provides extensibility to support integration of other types of data directly, or through references. By using the Medical Imaging Server for DICOM, organizations can store references to imaging data in FHIR and enable queries across clinical and imaging datasets.
